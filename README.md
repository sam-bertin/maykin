Sure, here's an example README that you can use as a starting point:

Maykin Django App
=================

This is a Django app for the Maykin case study. It uses Docker for deployment and requires a `.env` file for configuration.
Make sure to replace the parts in between brackets `< >` with your own values. 

Setup
-----

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory with the following contents (replace the placeholder values with your own):
```makefile
# General Settings
DEBUG=1
SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey
ALLOWED_HOSTS='["*"]'

# Maykin Config
CSV_USERNAME=<username>
CSV_PASSWORD=<password>
CSV_CITY_URL=<city_url>
CSV_HOTEL_URL=<hotel_url>

# Superuser
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=<su_user>
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=<su_pass>
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=<su_email>
```
3. Build the Docker image by running the following command in the root of the project directory:
```
docker build -t maykin-django-app .
```
4. Start the Docker container in detached mode by running the following command:
```css
docker run -d --name maykin-django-container -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env maykin-django-app
```
This will start the container in the background and map port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 in the container. It will also pass the environment variables from the `.env` file to the container.

Usage
-----

To access the app, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the Maykin Django app homepage.

From the homepage, you can choose to log in using the credentials that you set for the Django superuser. This will give you access to the Django admin interface, where you can create new users and designate them as managers of a city of their choice. You can also create users who are not managers.

Managers can edit, add, or delete hotels in their designated city. Non-manager users can view all hotels, but cannot modify or delete them. The superuser has full access to all functionality.


To stop the container, run the following command:
```
docker stop maykin-django-container
```
To start the container again, run the following command:
```css
docker start maykin-django-container
```
To view the container logs, run the following command:
```
docker logs maykin-django-container
```
That's it! You should now be able to use the Maykin Django app with Docker.

Optional
--------

Start the scheduler to import data (every 5 min for now)
I might update to give the ability to configure the task interval for the user.

```
docker exec -it <container_name> bash -c "source /app/venv/bin/activate && python /app/manage.py start_scheduler"
```
